  title: What people are saying
  reviews:
    - quote: I attended this workshop last night and wanted to share that it was one of the best workshops I’ve ever attended. Leslie-Ann was a fantastic instructor, warm, thoughtful and welcoming. She created a space that was creative, curious and encouraging. I only regret that we had just two hours! I would have loved to participate in a series of workshops/classes or a half/full-day workshop with her. I made more progress in my creative writing in those two hours than I have in probably two years. If there is ever an opportunity to bring Leslie-Ann back for additional workshops, I do hope that you will consider it. I think everyone in the group last night would agree.

    - quote: I have only been a member of the American Library in Paris for a few short months, but I can already say that it’s one of the best membership choices I’ve ever made. Thanks for this great programming!
