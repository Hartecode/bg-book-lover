## Leslie-Ann Murray

I want you to watch the book reviews, buy the books, and share these writers’ books as if you are spilling the tea. We are all responsible for shifting the canon, and I want us to do that together.

My name is Leslie Ann Murray and I’m a fiction writer and book lover from Trinidad and Tobago. I’m currently living in a small country town in Massachusetts, New England, but before living here I’ve lived in France, Bangladesh, China, South Africa, and New York City.

My favorite country to live in besides Trinidad is viva la France! I loved, loved living in Paris because it’s Paris. But really, I had so many friends living in nearby cities and countries that I got to see them often. You know friendships are our greatest love stories, so I was constantly falling in love. Yes, I did venture outside of Paris to the countryside any chance I got.

I really love to spend my life constantly traveling, having adult playdates, reading, reviewing books, and writing novels.
